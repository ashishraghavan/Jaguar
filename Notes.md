If there was no bi-directional relationship between User and Device, deleting a user which is associated to multiple devices will throw an error. On having a bi-directional relationship, on deleting a user, all devices associated to this user will also be deleted. This probably behaves as a parent-child relationship, where the parent is the User and the child is the device. When you delete the parent (the User), the child (the device associated to the user) is also deleted, which is desirable since a device which does not belong to a user does not serve any purpose.
